1) Added new scripting function:
Mdl_SetHumBodyType(C_NPC npc, string type) - The function adds a prefix to the textures of the body and head of the NPC.

For example:
instance EBR_108_Velaya(Npc_Default)
{
	name[0] = "Velaya";
	Mdl_SetVisual (self, "BABE.MDS");
	
	// body variation = 0
	// head variation = 0
	// skin color = 1
	Mdl_SetVisualBody (self, "Bab_body_Naked0", 0, 1, "Bab_Head_Hair1", 0, DEFAULT, -1);
	
	// ...
	// set new 'body type'
	Mdl_SetHumBodyType(self, "Velaya");
};

Then the textures for it will be as follows:
For body - "BAB_BODY_VELAYA_V0_C1.TGA"
For head - "BAB_HEAD_VELAYA_V0_C1.TGA"

Likewise for NPC men, only in this case the prefix "HUM_" is used.
For example:
"HUM_BODY_PSIONIC_V5_C0"
"HUM_HEAD_PSIONIC_V11_C0"


2) Added new scripting constant for debug mode:
const int HumBodyStyleSystem_DebugMode = 1;

If a constant is declared in scripts and its value is equal to "1", then the textures not found for the bodies and heads of the NPC become red.

If its value is "0" or just not declared, then the old rendering system works for NPCs with not found textures.

At the end of the tests, you can delete.

These call options reset the render system to the old one:
Mdl_SetHumBodyType(self, "");
Mdl_SetHumBodyType(self, "Naked");
